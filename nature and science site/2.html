                    <p>Worlds in which the world was rosy were born. Most of my life was spent in Kırıklareli,<br>
                         the good times I spent there are still in my dreams. For me, that's where he has everything.<br>
                          We had some difficulties, we had our bad days, we had our good days, but at the end of the day, <br>
                          it was too much for me. Therefore, if my own enemies were reading this article, they sent <br>
                          me back to Edirne or something :D I love nature and sports natures. It always gives me more <br>
                          pleasure to look at places by examining new places. That's why I often go on nature walks.<br>
                           In my remaining time, I usually live out my experiences and consume something new. <br>
                           At the same time, I am a very social person because it is nice to do many activities with you.<br>
                            I am currently living in İzmir and at the same time I am studying at Ege University. <br>
                            My life continues to progress in the form of action and adventure, as it did in my childhood. <br>
                            But on this site where I coded line by line, which I did not want to pass <br>
                            without saying, the most challenging part for me was here. Since there is no <br>
                            limit limit rule, I find myself writing pages and pages whenever I start writing. <br>
                            That's why I made my article more concise. I want to scream while I'm talking about the <br>
                            ready speech. I want to set up this site, my CV, to the internet, and its purpose was to make <br>
                            a simple, eye-catching site that can be spoken by everyone. It was a project that was always<br>
                             on my mind, I had made similar sites before, but they were mostly content such as nature and<br>
                              technology. From my single structuring works to the publishing phase of websites<br>
                               Apart from this, I do data analysis with Cbs at a basic level  I code games, mobile and pc games with C#,<br>
                                 I also have a great interest in cyber security and graphic design. <br>
                                 activity mountaineering and cycling. My article ends here. I hope everything will be fine,<br>
                                  thank you for taking the time to read my article, take care and goodbye (:</p>
